Python projects, similar to YDbf
--------------------------------

 * <http://code.activestate.com/recipes/362715/> -- original code
   by Raymond Hettinger, YDbf inspired by.

 * <http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/pydbf> -- DBF reader and writer,
   also inspired by code of Raymond Hettinger. If you are familiar
   with Django, you want to look pydbf, because it's API for
   describing DBF structure looks closer to Django model API.

 * <http://py-dbase.sourceforge.net/> -- reader and writer for DBF,
   by Greg Burnet. Gives high abstraction for DBF files, could read and write
   single records. Seems to be unsupported (last change in 2003).

 * <http://www.fiby.at/dbfpy/> -- reader and writer for DBF, by Jeff Kunce and
   Hans Fiby. Looks similar to py-dbase. Seems to be unsupported (last change 
   in 2001).

 * <http://www.garshol.priv.no/download/software/python/dbfreader.py> --
   reader for DBF files by Lars M. Garshol. dbfreader have interesting 
   feature -- it's support memo fields. All other stuff seems ordinarily.

 * <http://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/users/santoso/dbf.py.src> -- another reader,
   which supports memo fields too, by Yusdi Santoso.
